This project aims to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input.

### __Installation__
To begin, run ```npm install``` to load required modules to your directory. Then, run ```node index.js``` to initialize the applicaiton. This will prompt you in the terminal with questions. Answer the questions and the README.md will be generated in the newReadme folder in the same parent directory as your index.js file.

### __Usage__
